主从复制的配置部分主要集中在

# 建立主从关系

有两种方式建立主从关系：

1）在从机配置文件中添加下面的配置。
```text
replicaof 192.168.1.1 6379
```
2）在从机中执行 REPLICAOF 命令。此时主从开始同步。

补充：如果主机配置了requirepass密码，那么还需要在从机中做下面的操作（二选一）。

1）在从机配置文件中添加下面的配置。
```text
masterauth <password>
```
2）执行 `config set masterauth <password>` 命令。



# 开启无磁盘化同步

在主机中配置文件中添加下面的配置。
```text
repl-diskless-sync
```

diskless-sync-delay

# 从机开启只读模式

从Redis2.6开始，默认开启主机只读模式，即从机只接受读操作，拒绝写操作。

对从机只读模式的修改有下面的方式：
1）修改配置文件中的 `replica-read-only`项。
2）运行时，执行 CONFIG SET命令。

从机接收写操作会带来主从一致性的问题。

那么有下面的建议：
- 不要在支持写操作的从机中写入主机中存在的键。
- 将从机配置为不可写。 Don't configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system. In general, don't configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.

Historically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas. As of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means. For example:

Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like SUNIONSTORE and ZINTERSTORE. Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as SUNION and ZINTER.

Using the SORT command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica). Instead, use SORT_RO, which is a read-only command.

Using EVAL and EVALSHA are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands. Instead, use EVAL_RO and EVALSHA_RO where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.

While writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.

Before version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set. This means that if you use EXPIRE or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory. Redis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases). Note though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using EXPIRE on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.

Also note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:

A ---> B ---> C
Even if B is writable, C will not see B writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance A.
